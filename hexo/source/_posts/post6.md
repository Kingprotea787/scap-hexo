# **Preface**

## **What is Yakkai?**

Yakkai (厄介; やっかい; yakkai) is a term derived from Japanese,
originally meaning actions that inconvenience or disturb others.
In recent years, this term has taken on a new dimension,
describing disruptive behaviors at live events where inappropriate cheering or actions may negatively impact the experience of surrounding audiences.
Common examples include shouting "Yet Tiger!" (イェッタイガー) at idol lives where such calls are unsuitable,
misusing overly bright cyalumes,
which is also referred to as "light pollution",
and activating cyalumes by violently striking them against barriers and sometimes even throwing them as if they were grenades \[^1].

## **About this manual**

The title of this manual,
*The Fundamental of Mixes and its Applications*,
reflects its purpose as a guide to Yet Tiger! — one of the core practices of yakkai behavior.
This manual aims to make it easier for newcomers to get started with yakkai,
providing a structured introduction to these practices,
saving beginners the time and effort otherwise spent on scattered resources and self-study.

The contents of this manual are organized as follows:

The first part introduces the theoretical foundations,
including various common and uncommon mixes.
These types of mixes frequently appear in many call guides for different songs,
and we may adjust the order of sections over time to make learning more efficient for new users,
prioritizing mixes by frequency of use.

The second part covers practical applications.
Here, we will analyze popular songs from both mainstream and underground idol groups,
presenting them in a full song-and-call format to help learners use mixes and other yakkai techniques appropriately.

Additionally, we are also planning to include exercises to enhance the reader’s understanding of contents covered in the manual.

Finally,
we have to emphasize that this manual is for educational purposes only,
and we strongly advise against using any of the discussed behaviors in real-life live concerts,
as doing so could disrupt the experience for performers and audiences alike.
